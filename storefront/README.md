## Storefront Development

1. From the storefront directory, install dependencies:
```
cd storefront & npm install
```
2. Start Storybook:
- This project uses Storybook as a tool for UI development. 
- Components can be built in isolation, rendered on the storybook interface and tested. 
- See Storybook docs for more info: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction
```
npm run storybook
```
